Description:
    The class-d amplifier project is a high-efficiency DIY audio amplifier 
that does not rely on commercially available audio amplifier ICs.  It is 
capable of two channels of amplification with output powers of up to 50W RMS 
per channel.

In this directory:
* single-supply-bridged schematic and layout:  The most recent (and only supported) version, 50W max output
* class-d-amp-single-supply schematic and pcb:  An untested lower-output version, appx. 15W per channel 
* class-d-amp-3-5-mm sch/pcb:  A dual-supply version, 25W per channel max.  Not recommended for construction.
* class-d-amp sch/pcb:  The original board layout.  Self-destructed during first test.  Do not build.
